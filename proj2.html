                <h6><strong>Enhanced Interaction :</strong></h6>
                <p>Experts say that apps in education can make student more interactive and activate better engagement between faculty and student. The most effective way is to engage with the student while they are using applications. Interaction tendency
                    in student is enhanced by mobile applications.</p>
                <h6><strong>Student-teacher communication :</strong></h6>
                <p>The ideal concept of frequent student teacher interactions finds its space in the articles and books regarding performance enhancement but not in reality. Owing to the tight schedule of both the parties, it is just not possible to
                    maintain the rapport through physical interactions. But now, we have apps. Teachers can attend to the queries of the student’s anytime and anywhere through an ominous device called the phone. This fosters transparency regarding
                    the student’s growth at college.</p>
                <h6><strong>Availability 24/7 :</strong></h6>
                <p>Unlike college, mobile applications are available round the clock. No need to be worried about schedules. Anywhere can be a classroom. App learning is not time-bound learning, its relaxed learning. Most of the apps promote student-friendly
                    control. student should only need to reach out for the device when they feel like learning. Little ones can operate it without much effort.</p>
